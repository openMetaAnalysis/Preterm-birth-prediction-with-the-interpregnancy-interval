# Conservative phlebotomy for reducing blood transfusions

A living systematic review

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that conservative phlebotomy *pending* effective at reducing transufusions due to iatrogenic anemia. The heterogenteity as measured by I2 was '[pending](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at xx%.
