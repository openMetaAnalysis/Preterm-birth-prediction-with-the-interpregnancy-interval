# Corticosteroids for sepsis

A living systematic review

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that low dose corticosteroids in patients with septic shock who are hypotensive despite pressors *may be* effective at reducing mortality. While the Cochrane Collaboration (citation below) found significant benefit in the subgroup of patients iwht septic shock, the Cochrane used Mantel-Haenszel fixed estimator. This method may be too optimistic because the heterogenteity as measured by I2 was '[moderate](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 57%. In this setting the Knapp-Hartung estimator may be better.(PMID: [24727843](https://pubmed.gov/24727843) )

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that updates a previously published meta-analysis.(1) Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references. 

This repository is a limited review and contains outcomes data only without PICO and Risk of Bias Tables.  This review does not include a GRADE Profile or Summary of Findings Table.

See [methods](http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html) for details.

**Results:** Details of the studies included are in the:
* [Description of studies (PICO table)](../../tree/master/study-details/pico-table.md) (not available)
* [Risk of bias assessment](../../tree/master/study-details/risk-of-bias.md) (not available)
* [Forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) ([source data](../../tree/master/data))
* [Meta-regressions](../../tree/master/metaregression) ([source data](../../tree/master/data))
* [Reconciliation of conclusions and trials included with prior meta-analyses](../../tree/master/reconcilation-tables) (not available)

The forest plot for the primary outcomes are below. Additional [forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) of secondary analyses may be available.
